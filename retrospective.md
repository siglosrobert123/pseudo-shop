# Final Project Retrospective

## Team Members
- Student 1: Warren Denzel F. Cheng
- Student 2: John Robert H. Siglos

## 1. How did you divide the work between you and your partner?

We divided the four features evenly. Student 1 worked on features 1 and 2, while student 2 worked on features 3 and 4. After thorough discussion via GMeet, the basis of selection were features 3 and 4 since they are the closest features related, they were paired for an even split.

## 2. What Git strategies or commands helped you most during the project?

One of the most helpful strategies was the isolation of features using Git branches. Since workload was divided, this allowed us to isolate our individual work while maintaining a collaborative environment through the use of commands like git merge when we were done with each feature. 

Another strategy was through the use of frequent commits. Frequent commits allowed us to slowly but surely modify the code while ensuring that we have frequent backups we can restore to that is recent in case of the scenario where something breaks.

These strategies helped us optimize and maintain a workflow that was effective for our team during this project. 

## 3. Describe a merge conflict you encountered. What caused it and how did you resolve it?

The conflict happened during the merging of the final feature Display Storefront. The cause was that we both had edits on the file store_view.pseudo, since the filter products function from first feature was also stored in this file. It was resolved by manually editing the mentioned conflicted file and keeping the functions from both edits, since they are different functions that do not conflict with each other in terms of the code. After removing the conflict warnings in the file, it was then saved and the we proceeded with the merge successfully. 

## 4. What were the biggest challenges you faced as a team?

The biggest challenge we faced was maintaing the proper workflow during the whole pseudo-shop. Since this was a first for both of us, we had challenges in knowing what to do next in certain parts of the pseudo-shop. However, we were able to overcome these challenges by maintaining proper communication and ensuring quality work all throughout our collaboration in this workshop.

## 5. What did you learn about using Git in a collaborative setting?

As a version control system, the ability to have backups of our works and being able to view changes in the codebase by each team member along with the added ownership that showcases accountability of each team member are viable in maintaining a healthy, efficient, and productive collaborative environment in a team. 

## 6. How would you improve your workflow next time?

Always keep in mind and practice regular updates in terms of communicating with the team and ensuring that local codebase you have is always up to date with the main branch. In line with this, any changes made by you should be properly communicated with the team so that they may adjust and also update their local codebases if needed.

Frequent commits should also be practiced so that you also have latest backups of whatever you are working with. This is to avoid lengthy code edits that may potentially cause conflicts unknowingly by ensuring that the team has a backup they can restore to without losing much progress.

## 7. Optional: Any feedback on the activity?

The pseudo-shop worked well as an interactive learning for us as it simulated a real-world collaborative experience.
